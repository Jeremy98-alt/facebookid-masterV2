# facebookid-masterV2

This is a project that I made with my colleague Luca Occhipinti. We make an analysis of our friends, We create an icon network based on a chain of mutual friends. For each person we extracting the information and then make a new icon network based on friends's similarity features

# Usage

1.  Extracts your friend and mutual_friends 
2.  Open GetInformations1.4.py for getting information about you and your friends
3.  Open StatisticalInformation1.1.py, make a statitic execution where obtain a file where there are friends similar to you and for each friend
4.  Open network.1.2.py, you can choose two types of execution modality:
       *  the first consists to create a network of friends similar to you and your friends, then you can obtain information for each node like clustering coefficient and the relative entropy
       *  the second consists to create a network with your friends, but different centrality measures 

# ATTENTION
